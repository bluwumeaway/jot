A fenced div cannot interrupt a paragraph, without
an intervening blank line.

```
Paragraph text
::::
Hi
::::
.
<p>Paragraph text
::::
Hi
::::</p>
```

A fenced div need not have attributes or a class name.

```
::::
Hi
::::
.
<div>
<p>Hi</p>
</div>
```

The closing fence must be at least as long as the opening fence.

```
::::::::: foo
Hi
::::
.
<div class="foo">
<p>Hi
::::</p>
</div>
```
